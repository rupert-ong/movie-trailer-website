## Quick start

Here's what you need to do to view the web page:

1. Install [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2. Once Python is installed, run the IDLE application
3. Open `entertainment_center.py` in IDLE. From the menu select `Run` followed by `Run Module`. This will generate a file called `index.html`.


### What's included

Within the downloaded files, you will see a structure like this:

```
movie_trailer_website/
├── entertainment_center.py
├── fresh_tomatoes.py
├── media.py
└── index.html

```

This project is dependent on the [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com) framework and the [jQuery](http://jquery.com) library.
